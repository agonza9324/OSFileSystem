What we need to do:
  1: Add ls
  2: Add cat
  3: Add cd
  4: Add nano
  5: Added _Filename_ to _Directory_ after creating a file in a directory
  6: If multiple directories are created display all of them
  7: Make each command one line( instead of mkdir \n "type blah blah blah" directoryName we will have mkdir directoryName)
